# backgrid-example

Just a minimal HTML for the Backgrid example at http://backgridjs.com/

This example must be served with a web server.

When I opened index.html from the local disk with file:// URL on Chrome,
it failed to get examples/territories.json with the following error:

No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
application/json
